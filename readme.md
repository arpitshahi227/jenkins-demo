# Sample Test Automation Framework (POC)

This is a **sample Proof of Concept (POC)** test automation framework built using:

- **Python**
- **Pytest**
- **Requests** (for API testing)
- **Selenium** (for UI testing)
- **HTML Reporting**


To run the tests
```
pytest --html=reports/report.html --self-contained-html
````

This framework is for demo/POC purposes only.

We can extend it further based on your project needs.

Right now as part of POC this single repo contains both Jenkins file and the QA code but on the larger scale, it can be divided separately.
